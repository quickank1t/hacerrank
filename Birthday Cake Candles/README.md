# Problem

Colleen is having a birthday! She will have a cake with one candle for each year of her age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.

Find and print the number of candles she can successfully blow out.

# Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of candles on the cake. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers, where each integer  describes the height of candle .

# Constraints

Output Format 
Print the number of candles the can be blown out on a new line.

# Sample Input 

4
3 2 1 3

# Sample Output 

2
# Explanation 

The maximum candle height is 3 and there are two candles of that height.

# Solution

Approch 1: with time complexity 0(N * N)

1. find the biggest element from the array of candels by iterating over N times
2. And then count the number of times the biggest number occurance again by iterating over N times

Approch 2: With time complexity O(N) (<a href="https://github.com/quickank1t/hacerrank/blob/master/Birthday%20Cake%20Candles/src/Solution.java">Solution</a>   )

1. Define a hashtable
2. iterate N times and <br>
  a. if key is not there in hashtable then insert in hashtable with key= size of the candel and value= count of the number as 1 <br>
  b. else increment the count of the number by 1 for hash table with key <br>
  c. also keep a track of the highest number<br>
3. just get the hashvalue with key= highest number
