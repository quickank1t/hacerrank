# Problem

Colleen is having a birthday! She will have a cake with one candle for each year of her age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.

Find and print the number of candles she can successfully blow out.

# Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of candles on the cake. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers, where each integer  describes the height of candle .

# Constraints

Output Format 
Print the number of candles the can be blown out on a new line.

# Sample Input 

4
3 2 1 3

# Sample Output 

2
# Explanation 

The maximum candle height is 3 and there are two candles of that height.

# Solution

Approch 1: with time complexity 0(N * N)

1. find the biggest element from the array of candels by iterating over N times
2. And then call the count the number of biggest number again by iterating over N times

Making the time compleyity N square 

Approch 2: With time complexity O(N)

1. Define a hashtable
2. iterate the complete
